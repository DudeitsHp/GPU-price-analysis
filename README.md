# GPU Insights: Exploring GPU Performance and Price with Power BI

Welcome to the GPU Insights GitHub repository! This project focuses on analyzing GPU performance and price data using Power BI to help users make informed decisions when selecting a graphics card. Whether you're a gamer, content creator, or tech enthusiast, GPU Insights provides valuable insights into the trade-off between performance and price for various GPUs.

## Project Overview

GPU Insights encompasses the following components:

- **Data Collection and Merging:** Collected GPU data from multiple sources, merged and cleansed the data using Excel, and enriched it for analysis.
- **Price-to-Performance Calculation:** Calculated the price-to-performance ratio for each GPU to assess the value proposition.
- **Power BI Visualization:** Utilized Power BI to create interactive visualizations, aiding users in understanding the relationship between GPU performance and price.
